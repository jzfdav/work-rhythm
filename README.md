A calm, passive, clock-like PWA built to help professionals transition back into the rhythm of office life. Optimized for high-end Android hardware (OnePlus 13).

## 🕰️ Philosophy & Purpose

**This is not a game.**

WorkRhythm is a **re-entry companion** for professionals returning to the workplace after a long leave of absence—whether it’s a vacation, parental leave, recovery, or a career break.

Re-adjusting to the rigid structure, recurring meetings, and mental tempo of an office day can be a jarring experience. This app bridges that gap by providing a **low-stakes, simulated workday environment** that helps re-calibrate your internal clock.

- **Mental Re-calibration**: Simulated meetings and tasks help set your mind for a structured day, easing the transition from absolute freedom back to a regular schedule.
- **No Guilt, No Score**: Unlike games, there is no "winning" or "losing". Miss a meeting? That's fine. Ignore the app for hours? Also fine. The goal is simply to be *present* with the rhythm.
- **Calm by Default**: Language is neutral ("Urgent Task" instead of "Firefighting"). Dark mode is default. Interactions are fluid and quiet.

## ✨ Features

- **Chrono-Dynamic Background**: Procedural mesh gradients that evolve minute-by-minute.
- **Dynamic Agenda**: Unique daily schedules generated with diverse "flavors" (Meeting Intesive, Deep Focus, etc.).
- **Workload Balance**: Visualizes the varying intensity of a workday, from "chaotic" fire-fighting to "balanced" flows.
- **Physical Depth & Sheen**: Multi-layered Benthal shadows and inner highlights for a tactile hardware feel.
- **Adaptive Variable Typography**: Living text transitions utilizing the full Inter Variable axis.
- **Horological Precision**: Synchronized timers and a high-precision progress line.
- **Handheld Ergonomics**: All tertiary controls optimized for the "Thumb Zone".
- **Advanced PWA**: Edge-to-edge immersion with dynamic system-level theme-color syncing.

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

**Zero Telemetry. 100% Offline.**

We believe that your recovery and work habits are private.
- **No Analytics**: We do not track how you use the app.
- **No Cloud**: All data lives in your browser's `localStorage`.
- **Data Sovereignty**: You can **Export** your data to JSON or **Reset Everything** at any time from the Settings menu.
