# Rules: DO NOT

## Engagement & UX
- **DO NOT** add any "engagement" features (gamification, streaks, points, badges).
- **DO NOT** add notifications, sounds, or vibrations that demand attention.
- **DO NOT** add a "Welcome" or "Onboarding" flow. The user should land directly in the experience.
- **DO NOT** add "time remaining" or countdowns. This creates anxiety.
- **DO NOT** ask for user input. No forms, no buttons, no settings.

## Technical
- **DO NOT** use `any` in TypeScript. Be strict.
- **DO NOT** use `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or `IndexedDB` (Stateless philosophy applies).
- **DO NOT** add analytics or tracking scripts.
