# Product Vision: The Anti-Productivity Tool

**Office Simulator** is a digital clock dressed in business casual.

It exists to provide a comforting, low-stakes tether to the rhythm of the working world for those who are currently outside of it. It offers the *structure* of a workday without the *pressure* of work.

## Core Value Proposition
For users recovering from burnout, illness, or extended leave, the vast emptiness of unstructured time can be daunting. "Office Simulator" fills that silence with a familiar, non-demanding hum.

It says: *"It is 10:00 AM. The world is in Deep Focus right now. You are safe here."*
